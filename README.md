Hi! Welcome to Dispatch Optimization, where you can view how to improve the emergency services of the San Francisco Area. Here are some things to note before using this product:

Prerequisites: Before using this app, make sure that you have a browser that supports most javacript and html operations, as well as Internet. This project uses Pandas, Seaborn, Folium, and MatPlotLib, so Internet is necessary to obtain required materials.

Functions:

1) Graphs: There are three visualizations of the data to help the user understand the dataset

2) Function: By imputting a valid time and address, the user can see what is the most likely dispatch that is needed for that location

3) The longest dispatch call to on scene time for locations. This shows the severity of the traffic problem in San Francisco, and offers some solutions for this as well. Dispatch time was calculated as described because this is the most accurate way to measure essentially the transport time to the location. 

4) Cluster Map: The user can view the frequency of calls in the area.

Code: View the code by looking at the "code" directory.  Jupyter notebook was used to visualize the Python 3 graphs, and Pandas was used to manipulate the data(meaning queries). HTML documents are also provided for those who may not have jupyter notebook installed.

Design: Materialize was used as the base template for the site, and features such as parallelax, cards, and forms were implemented to provide the user a better experience when using the site.
